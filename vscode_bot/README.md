  * or press `F1`, then type `Open Chat Room`

## How it works?

* The real-time Chat Room service is bulit on top of [Azure SignalR Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-signalr/)
* the Chat Bot is bulit on top of [Turing Robot API](http://www.turingapi.com/)

##Limitation

Currently, the Chat Bot only works well with Chinese. If you chat with English, it will usually translate it into Chinese. It would be a good English-Chinese translator. :)
